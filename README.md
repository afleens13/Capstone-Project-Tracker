# Capstone-Project-Tracker

The application is for the utilization of tracking a project over a duration of time. This application intends to provide people with the opportunity to add a project to include the budgetary requirements, and track the milestones of the project. The user, dependant upon their role will have set permissions to either add, assign or just view the information within the application. This app should provide the necessary information to the stakeholder so they are able to view the project in real time.
